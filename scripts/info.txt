There are two ways to create a executable from the generate.py
1. 	using py2exe with the setup.py script (did not work 5-9-2019).
2  	using pyinstaller. download pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller). 
	Run pyinstaller generate.py to create the executable.
	The executable is created at dist/generate/*
